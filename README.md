# PeerPrep

Project based on my group's [CS3219](git@github.com:guowei42/peerprep.git) project from NUS, PeerPrep. This repo aims to revamp the project to be a tidier and feature complete.

This project can match two users based on a matchmaking criteria. The two users then can complete a coding challenge together.
